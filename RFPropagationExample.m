%% Modeling the Propagation of Radar Signals
% This example shows how to model several RF propagation effects. These
% include free space path loss, atmospheric attenuation due to rain, fog
% and gas, and multipath propagation due to bounces on the ground. The
% discussion in this example is based on the ITU-R P series recommendations
% of the International Telecommunication Union. ITU-R is the radio

%% Introduction
% To properly evaluate the performance of radar and wireless communication
% systems, it is critical to understand the propagation environment. The
% received signal power of a monostatic radar is given by the radar range
% equation:
%
% $$ P_r = \frac{P_tG^2\sigma\lambda^2}{(4\pi)^3R^4L}$$
%
% where $P_t$ is the transmitted power, $G$ is the antenna gain, $\sigma$
% is the target radar cross section (RCS), $\lambda$ is the wavelength, and
% $R$ is the propagation distance. All propagation losses other than free
% space path loss are included in the $L$ term. The rest of the example
% shows how to estimate this $L$ term in different scenarios.

%% Free Space Path Loss
% Free space path loss is computed as a function of propagation distance 
% and frequency. In free space, RF signals propagate at the speed of light
% in all directions. At a far enough distance, the radiating source looks 
% like a point in space and the wavefront forms a sphere whose radius is 
% equal to $R$. The power density at the wavefront is inversely
% proportional to $R^2$:
%
% $$ \frac{P_t}{4\pi R^2} $$
%
% where $P_t$ is the transmitted signal power. For a monostatic radar where
% the signal has to travel both directions (from the source to the target
% and back), the dependency is actually inversely proportional to $R^4$, as
% shown previously in the radar equation. The loss related to this
% propagation mechanism is referred to as free space path loss, sometimes
% also called the spreading loss. Quantitatively, free space path loss is
% also a function of frequency, given by [5]:
%
% $$L_{fs} = 20*\log_{10}(\frac{4\pi R}{\lambda}) \quad dB$$
%
% As a convention, propagation losses are often expressed in dB. This
% convention makes it much easier to derive the two-way free space path
% loss by simply doubling the one-way free space loss. 
%
% Use the |fspl| function to calculate the free-space path loss, and plot
% the loss for frequencies between 1 and 1000 GHz, for different ranges.

% The figure shows that the propagation loss increases with range and
% frequency.

%% Propagation Loss Due to Precipitation and Atmosphere
% In reality, signals do not always travel in a vacuum, so free space path
% loss describes only part of the signal attenuation. Signals interact with
% particles in the air and lose energy along the propagation path. The loss
% varies with different factors such as pressure, temperature, and water
% density.
% 
%%
% *Loss Due to Rain and Snow*
%
% Rain can be a major limiting factor for radar systems, especially when
% operating above 5 GHz. In the ITU model in [2], rain is characterized by
% the rain rate (in mm/h). According to [6], the rain rate can range from
% less than 0.25 mm/h for very light rain to over 50 mm/h for extreme
% rains. In addition, because of the rain drop's shape and its relative
% size compared to the RF signal wavelength, the propagation loss due to
% rain is also a function of signal polarization. In general, horizontal 
% polarization represents the worst case for propagation loss due to rain.
%
% The functions |rainpl| and |cranerainpl| can be used to compute losses
% due to rain according to the ITU and Crane models, respectively. Both
% models are valid between 1 GHz and 1 THz. Let the polarization be
% horizontal, so the tilt angle is 0, and let the signal propagate parallel
% to the ground, so the elevation angle is 0. Plot losses computed with
% both models and compare.

R0 = 5e3;                % 5 km range
rainrate = [1 4 20];     % rain rate in mm/h
el = 0;                  % 0 degree elevation
tau = 0;                 % horizontal polarization

for m = 1:numel(rainrate)
    rainloss_itu(:,m) = rainpl(R0,freq,rainrate(m),el,tau)';

%%
% The losses computed with the Crane model are mostly larger than the 
% losses computed with the ITU model at this propagation range. At smaller
% propagation ranges and lower frequencies, the ITU model may output a 
% smaller attenuation value than Crane. Note that the models differ greatly 
% enough that at higher frequencies, light rainfall for one model may 
% have the same attenuation as moderate rainfall for the other model.

%%
% Similar to rainfall, snow can also have a significant impact on the
% propagation of RF signals. A common practice is to treat snow as
% rainfall and compute the propagation loss based on the rain model, even
% though this approach tends to overestimate the loss a bit. Attenuation
% due to propagation through snow is not considered dependent on
% polarization, but is highly dependent on frequency. The model for losses
% due to snow is parameterized by the equivalent liquid content instead of
% volume. For a given water content, snow requires about 10 times as much
% volume as rain.
%
% Use the |snowpl| function to compute losses due to snow, and plot the
% losses against frequency. By default, this function uses the Gunn-East
% attenuation model, which is generally valid up to about 20 GHz.

%%
% *Loss Due to Fog and Cloud*
%
% Fog and cloud are formed with water droplets too, although much smaller
% compared to rain drops. The size of fog droplets is generally less than
% 0.01 cm. Fog is often characterized by the liquid water density. A medium
% fog with a visibility of roughly 300 meters, has a liquid water density
% of 0.05 g/m^3. For heavy fog where the visibility drops to 50 meters, the
% liquid water density is about 0.5 g/m^3. The atmosphere temperature (in
% Celsius) is also present in the ITU model for propagation loss due to fog
% and cloud [3].
%
% Use the |fogpl| function to compute losses due to fog, and plot the losses against
% frequency. The ITU model for attenuation due to fog is valid between 
% 10 GHz and 1 THz.

freq = (10:1000)*1e9;

title('Fog Attenuation');

%%
% Note that in general fog is not present when it is raining.

%%
% *Loss Due to Atmospheric Absorption and Lensing*
%
% Even when there is no fog or rain, the atmosphere is full of gases that
% still affect the signal propagation. The ITU model [4] describes
% atmospheric gas attenuation as a function of both dry air pressure, like
% oxygen, measured in hPa, and water vapour density, measured in g/m^3.
%
% Use the |tropopl| function to compute losses due to atmospheric
% absorption, and plot the losses against frequency. By default, this
% function uses the Mean Annual Global Reference Atmosphere (MAGRA) model
% to get typical values of temperature, pressure, and water vapor density
% for a given altitude. We can also specify a latitude model to use a model
% tailored for a specific range of latitudes. Some latitude models also
% allow for specification of a season. Let our altitude be 2 km (note that
% the troposphere, for which this model is valid, extends up to 10 km) and
% our propagation path be depressed by 5 degrees. This function returns the
% total loss due to atmospheric absorption over the slanted propagation
% path, but does not include dissipation due to refraction (lensing).
% Compare losses between the low, mid, and high latitude models.

title('Atmospheric Gas Attenuation');

%%
% The plot suggests that there is a strong absorption due to atmospheric
% gases at around 60 GHz.
%

%%
% Another source of losses due to atmosphere is from atmospheric lensing.
% This is a phenomenon whereby the angular extent of a transmission is
% increased with range due to a refractivity gradient. This spreading of
% energy decreases the energy density along the nominal (straight) 
% propagation path, independent of frequency.
%
% Atmospheric pressure, and thus refractivity, changes with altitude. So
% for a given height, the elevation angle of the propagation path is enough
% to determine losses due to this effect.

%%
% Attenuation due to lensing decreases as altitude increases. For
% convenience, attenuation due to lensing is also provided as a secondary
% output from |tropopl|.

%%
% *Loss Due to Polarization Mismatch*
%
% Some types of propagation loss are dependent on the polarization of the
% transmitted radiation, such as with rain loss. This is a result of the
% chemical and structural properties of the medium. However, even in free
% space there may be losses due to a mismatch of the propagated
% polarization vector and the polarization of the receiving antenna. For
% example, if the propagated polarization vector is orthogonal to the
% polarization of the receiving antenna, almost no direct signal energy
% would be received. Note that the propagated polarization vector is not
% in general the same as the transmitted polarization vector, as the
% direction of propagation must be taken into account. Note also that the
% other loss functions which take polarization as an input do not compute
% losses due to this mismatch. Polarization-dependent losses due to
% properties of the propagation medium can be handled separately from
% losses due to polarization mismatch, as the latter is heavily dependent
% on the transmitter/receiver orientation.
%
% Use the |polloss| function to compute the loss due to polarization mismatch for a
% given transmit/receive polarization, platform positions, and platform
% orientations. Place the transmit platform at the origin with no rotation
% from inertial. Place the receive platform along the X axis and compute 
% polarization loss for a range of roll angles. Let the antenna
% polarizations both be vertical.

poltx = [0;1];  % [H;V] polarization
polrx = [0;1];
postx = [0;0;0];
posrx = [100;0;0];
frmtx = eye(3); % transmit frame aligned with inertial

% The attenuation approaches infinity at a 90 degree roll angle. 

%% Radar Propagation Factor and Vertical Coverage Diagram
% When transmitting over a wide angle or from an antenna close to the
% ground, multipath from ground bounce, along with refraction from
% atmosphere, yields a radiation pattern at a given range that can be quite
% different from the nominal transmit pattern. This is captured by the
% radar propagation factor, which is the ratio of the actual field strength
% relative to what the field strength would be in free space. The
% propagation factor can vary greatly as the relative phase between the
% direct and indirect path signals changes.
%
% A vertical coverage diagram (Blake chart) is a compact way of displaying
% contours of fixed signal energy (such as a minimum signal power for
% detection) as a function of propagation range and elevation angle. Only
% the vertical plane in which both the direct and indirect path signals
% propagate is considered.
%
% The function |radarvcd| takes a reference range as input and returns the
% range at which the received power in the multipath environment equals
% what it would be in free space. This effective range is plotted on a
% range-height-angle chart. This can quickly give, for example, the actual
% detection range given a free-space detection range, as a function of
% range, height, or elevation angle.
%
% Use a free-space detection range of 100 km, transmit frequencies in
% L-Band and C-Band, and an antenna height of 12 m. A sinc transmit pattern
% is used by default.

% Ground-bounce interference dominates the propagation factor for shorter

%% Multipath Propagation, Time Delays, and Doppler Shifts
% Signals may not always propagate along the line of sight, but arrive at
% the destination via different paths and may add up either constructively
% or destructively. This multipath effect can cause significant
% fluctuations in the received signal power.
%
% The functions mentioned in the previous sections for computing
% propagation losses are useful to establish budget links, but to simulate
% the propagation of arbitrary signals, you also need to apply
% range-dependent time delays, gains, and phase shifts. Various channel
% objects are available to model multipath propagation. For a simple
% line-of-sight path, use the |phased.LOSChannel| object to model the
% propagation subject to any of the loss types described previously.
%
% Ground reflection is a common phenomenon for many radar or wireless
% communication systems. For example, when a ground-based or sea-based
% radar illuminates a target, the signal not only propagates along the
% direct line of sight but is also reflected from the ground. Use the
% |twoRayChannel| object to model the combination of a direct path and
% single-bounce path, such as for ground reflection.

%%

% *Time Delays and Doppler Shifts*

%%
% Visualize the transmitted and propagated pulses and their normalized

% to the 50 km range of the target divided by the speed of light.
[delay, dop] = helperPlotDelayAndDopplerShift(wav,y2ray,waveform.SampleRate);
%%
estRange = delay*c*1e-3 % km
%%
% The channel also applied a Doppler shift that corresponds to the range 
% rate of the target. Compare the estimated value to the -200 m/s
% ground truth using the |dop2speed| and |freq2wavelen| functions.

%%
% The result suggests that in this configuration, the channel introduces an
% extra 19.6 dB loss to the received signal compared to the free space
% case. Now assume the target flies a bit higher at 1.8 km above the
% ground. Repeating the simulation above suggests that this time the ground
% reflection actually provides a 6 dB gain. Although free space path loss
% is essentially the same in the two scenarios, a 150 m move caused a 25.6
% dB fluctuation in signal power.

% This example provides an overview of RF propagation losses due to
